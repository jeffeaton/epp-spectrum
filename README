This project is an implementation of a combined implementation of the EPP and
Spectrum models used for UNAIDS HIV estimates. The purpose of this is to
integrate the demographic structure of the Spectrum model into the EPP model
used for estimating epidemic trends from surveillance data.

The repository maintains an R implementation and C++ implementation of the
model. Currently the demographic projection model takes an initial pulse and  
time series for the force of infection (r parameter), and implements the
R-spline model based on code from Dan Hogan. 

Eventually this will be extended to include the R-trend and EPP classic models. 
And then it will be extended to incorporate more flexible models for age-
specific incidence and force of infection.


Country-level input parameter values are read from country Spectrum files
available from UNAIDS: http://apps.unaids.org/spectrum/
These can be read into R using: https://github.com/jeffeaton/read-epp-spectrum

TODO:

- Tidy and document everything.
- Choose either C or C++.
- Bundle into an R package.
- Add read-epp-spectrum as submodule.
- Do research.
